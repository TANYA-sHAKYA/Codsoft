## TASK 1
### Titanic Survival Prediction
This exciting machine learning project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using data-driven techniques. It begins with data preprocessing, where we clean and prepare the raw information about passengers, such as age, gender, and class.

Next, through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncover interesting patterns, like the survival rates of different genders or class distinctions, visualizing the data with engaging graphs. The project then moves to feature engineering, creating new features to enhance our models’ accuracy. Afterward, we train various supervised classification algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression, teaching them to recognize patterns that indicate whether a passenger would survive.

Once trained, we evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision, testing how well our models can predict survival on unseen data. Finally, we visualize our findings to present insights and showcase the effectiveness of our models. This project merges history and technology, offering a captivating look at who made it through that fateful night and demonstrating the power of machine learning in analyzing complex datasets.

### Project Overview
This fascinating notebook-based project dives into the historical tragedy of the Titanic, utilizing a rich dataset that chronicles the experiences of the passengers aboard that ill-fated voyage. The main goal is to build and evaluate classification models that can predict whether a given passenger survived or perished in the disaster. The journey begins with data cleaning, where we sift through the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring the information is reliable and ready for  analysis. Next, we engage in feature engineering, creatively transforming the raw data into meaningful insights. This might involve deriving new variables from existing ones, such as extracting titles from names to understand social status or encoding categorical variables that could influence survival rates.

The excitement ramps up as we compare two powerful classification algorithms: Random Forest and XGBoost. The Random Forest model, known for its robustness and ability to handle diverse data, contrasts with XGBoost, which is celebrated for its efficiency and high performance in predictive tasks. Through this comparative analysis, we’ll see how well each model captures the nuances in the data and their effectiveness in predicting survival.
